Let's kick-off my dev blogging year by looking back onto the exciting three days I had last
week in Amsterdam. I had the opportunity to attend the <a href="https://frontenddeveloperlove.com/" target="_blank">frontenddeveloperlove</a>
and <a href="https://www.vuejs.amsterdam/" target="_blank">vuejs.amsterdam</a> conferences.

With this blog post I want to broadly capture my conference experience, learnings and latest trends in the JavaScript 
and especially VueJs ecosystem. I hope you are as excited as I am ;)


## Organisation

I don't want to bash any of the previous conferences I was, but my experiences in the last years at bigger confs regarding
organisation and care for attendees were quite mixed and not always that positive. For the <a href="https://frontenddeveloperlove.com/" target="_blank">frontenddeveloperlove</a> and 
<a href="https://www.vuejs.amsterdam/" target="_blank">vuejs.amsterdam</a> I can sum up the attendee experience as predominantly positive. Firstly, the Theater Amsterdam as venue was
amazing. I have not yet seen such a huge screen for the presentations.

The time schedule pretty much held throughout the three
days except the small changes due to the reason that two of the speakers were ill and could not make it to the conference.
Besides the technical part, organisation of food and drinks for the attendees was also quite well. Different food corners, coffee
drinks and other goodies did not let you back hungry or thirsty and formed an enjoyable conference day. Only the classic Wifi issue,
I basically had on any tech conference, was the same here.

## Quality of talks

It was only last year when I first got in touch with the Vue.js framework. However, I really liked it from the beginning
for its simplicity and flat learning curve. Luckily, I could learn quite a lot about it in the first few months and even 
use it on a green field project at my workplace. Thus, I was really looking forward to enhance my skills in Vue at this 
dedicated conference. As desired, I did not get disappointed in any way. Many of the talks were really great and eye-opening
for my upcoming frontend work. What was really astonishing to me is firstly the flexibility and size the Vue.js ecosystem
has built up over the last years and secondly the active and amazing community gathering this open source project. Listening
to many of the core team members, whereby some of them are even working full-time on Vue.js, brought me some really new insights.
Next to the Vue specific talks the first conference day tackled a wide palette of web coding parts like Bundlers, 
Babel, JavaScript Testing, Accessibility, or Animations. In the upcoming few paragraphs, I want to shortly walk through my 
personal highlights from the conference. Some of them I definitely have to look more deeply into in the next few weeks and months.

## Highlights

Obviously there is a lot of information I got out of those three days packed with talks. Personally I think there were 
a lot of useful things I want to leverage and try out in projects I am working on. Since I don't want to make this an extraordinary
long list, I picked my definite highlights.

### Webpack
The face behind webpack and core maintainer Sean Larkin held two talks which definitely stood out. Firstly, he knows how to
present rather complex stuff and secondly, he manages extremely
well to make listening to him pleasing. In his first talk at the <a href="https://frontenddeveloperlove.com/" target="_blank">frontenddeveloperlove</a>
he shared insights into the upcoming Webpack 5 version and promised important performance improvements due to things like "Persistent Caching".
You could really feel his passion about Webpack when he talked about the hard facts of understanding Webpack from the inside
out. Although it does not matter that much to frontend devs how webpack is bundling their things as long as they get an optimized
bundle with their app at the end of the chain, it grabbed my attention when he visually explained the inner workings of Webpack from
compilation to parsing and resolving. All in all the talks were definitely one of the best these days.

### Performance optimizations and PWA in Vue.js
Although I have been using Vue.js for some time now, tight project schedules have not yet given that much time to dive deeper
into performance optimization of Vue apps. So, I really liked the concise tips and tricks from Filip Rakowski and Eduardo San Martin Morote
to make Vue apps lighter and faster. Topics like lazy loading routes and components, which are shown conditionally, code splitting
or webpacks magic preload and prefetch comments showed me that it's not that complicated to optimize for performance. There are
even some low hanging fruits which can be implemented without hassle. Moreover, they also introduced some
great tools to monitor and analyze bundles I did not know before.

### Nuxt.js
This is one of the completely new technologies I learned about at the <a href="https://www.vuejs.amsterdam/" target="_blank">vuejs.amsterdam</a>. Before arriving at the 
Theater Amsterdam I only have heard of this framework called Nuxt.js in relation with news on Vue.js but had no idea what 
it actually is and what it can be used for. Gregg Pollack gave a very handy and practical introduction and showed on stage
how to scaffold and build a simple Nuxt.js app. It builds on top of Vue.js and what really inspired me is its power to 
create universal apps, which combine server-side rendering and SPA features, for an optimal user experience as well as SEO
friendliness. Sebastien Chopin (co-creator) of Nuxt.js subsequently talked about some advanced stuff and gave insights into
the team, organization and next steps for Nuxt.js. A third Nuxt related talk rounded up by showing that Nuxt.js can also 
serve very well as static site generator which solidifies the flexibility of the framework.    

### GraphQL
The fourth highlight for me which I want to name is GraphQL as it was not only mentioned once these days. Although the
APIs I am usually working on are solid with good old REST, some of the presented GraphQL features showed that it's worth
to try it out. Especially the explicitness of GraphQL when it comes to retrieving the desired data properties from an API
seems superior in contrast to traditional REST. Although some of these concepts where maybe a bit overwhelming initially,
GraphQL implementations as Apollo and the vue plugin vue-apollo were presented well so I could get an impression what can
be done with it.

## Conclusion
  
To wrap things up, Amsterdam was worth the journey :) The conferences were well organized and there did not occur 
annoying situations I have already experienced at other conferences. I noted down a lot of useful things among those three
days and could learn from the leading experts in the JavaScript and especially Vue.js community. Besides, mentioned highlights
it was also inspiring to listen to those full-time open source maintainers and their hard work they do for the JS community
like Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, who even had a dedicated talk regarding this topic. It's nice to hear that the Vue.js 
ecosystem continues to grow and 2019 is going to be exciting as well.
