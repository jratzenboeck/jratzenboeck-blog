Every software developer has their own selection of tools, frameworks, libraries and helper programs 
to ease their productivity in daily work-life. For many devs it would be a nightmare to install and configure all their 
things again in case their computer breaks at some point.

So let's pray that this will never happen... or dig into dotfiles ;)

## What are dotfiles?
If you are a more advanced user of a Unix based OS like Linux or MacOS you have probably already seen those special files
with a . in the beginning of their filename. They are not shown by default if you list your files with the standard `ls`
command or view them in a Finder window on a Mac. To put it simply, these files configure and customize installed tools
on your Mac (This blog post is targeted for MacOS although many of the things apply to a Linux OS as well). One of the 
most popular dotfiles are the configuration files for the selected shell like `.bashrc` (in case of bash) or `.zshrc` (in case of ZShell).
You probably have already adapted one of these files in the past to add you fresh jdk installation to the global `PATH` variable
or configured your git user along with some aliases. Fine, so you have already made some experience with dotfiles.
However, you are maybe in a situation like I was before digging deeper into the topic. So, keep reading and find out how 
to actually use dotfiles in a more sophisticated manner.

## How to use them?
You would probably laugh at me, if I would answer this question simply with "Put the files into separate folders" but actually
there is not much more magic behind it. It's a matter of structure and organization which make them powerful and enable
the further steps described in later paragraphs of this post. By default your dotfiles reside in the root of your home directory where some of them,
as the shell configuration or .gitconfig even have to be, to work properly. However, symlinks allow to move your files
in a `~/dotfiles` folder and reference them from your home directory.

The awesome thing with your separate dotfiles folder is that you can now easily manage your configuration files with
a VCS. This is exactly what you need when you want to setup a new machine. Lovely colors in the command line prompt, shell 
aliases which make you super productive can simply be pulled from a repository. If you love playing around with shell programming,
and happen to have some experience you can start right away crafting your dotfiles and linking them with a script automatically in your home
directory. However, I would highly recommend to you use the awesome community on github. There are several exceptionally
good dotfiles repositories you can get started with. Have a look at <a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/" target="_blank">dotfiles.github.io</a> for 
inspiration and fork one that looks good to you. They are more or less sophisticated and sometimes put more focus on specific
areas (eg web development). All of the repos I browsed provided a bootstrap script which sets up everything (like sourcing 
configurations in a `.bashrc` or `.zsrc` or creating symlinks in your home directory). It's great
because you do not have to do a lot of that grunt work yourself but how you setup the files for the tools of your choice is
up to you and your preferences. There is no one and only dotfiles project and that's why those projects are made to be forked and
shared back to the community. Throw away things you don't need, adapt things you want to have differently
and add new things. The structure of my dotfiles folder for instance looks like that:

## Automation with Homebrew
Now, that you know how you can get started with your dotfiles project, I want to some additional automation thing suitable
for MacOS which really impressed me. They are not directly related to dotfiles in particular but any popular dotfiles repo
on github contains it. I am talking about utilizing the automation power of the Homebrew package manaager. Although I have
used and liked Homebrew before, I found out that you can leverage automation with it. After installing Homebrew when executing
the bootstrap script, you can specify in a separate Brewfile which applications to install. An example of a Brewfile is shown below:

```
cask_args appdir: '/Applications'

tap 'homebrew/bundle'
tap 'caskroom/cask'

brew 'rbenv'
brew 'tig'
brew 'mysql'
brew 'nvm'
brew 'wget'
brew 'nginx'

cask 'google-chrome'
cask 'slack'
cask 'evernote'
cask 'spotify'
cask 'docker'
cask 'intellij-idea'

```
As shown in the example, even installing large binaries with the Homebrew-Cask extension can be done easily. 
Instead of doing that repetitive task of downloading and installing every application manually, a `./bootstrap`
execution in the Terminal is sufficient and after enjoying your Coffee everything is setup as you want it.

As a final note, I want to warn you from blindly executing the bootstrap script from any dotfiles project. Please make yourself
familiar with it before to prevent any unwanted action to the system. Better delete more things you probably won't need
when you are just starting out and add to your project later on what you might need.
 
## Conclusion
I hope I could convince you that managing dotfiles explicitly makes sense. First of all you have your complete configuration
setup organized in a central place which makes it tidier and easier to maintain. Secondly, dotfiles let you automate things
you maybe have not even thought of before. I could setup my fresh OS installation of my Macbook indeed just by executing
the bootstrap script and it was an order of minutes instead of hours or even longer. By the way, feel free to fork
