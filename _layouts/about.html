        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Jürgen, I am 24 years old and live in Linz, Austria.
            I am studying Computer Science at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz,
            working as a full-stack web developer at Tractive® and author this blog.</p>
        <h3>Technology and Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            My primary interest lies in web technologies starting with server-side development
            and ending with delivering great user experience on a web frontend.
            I am an open source enthusiast and I especially like the NodeJS ecosystem. I like playing around
            with the awesome stuff going on in this crazy web area and want to share my thoughts, experiences and
            knowledge I gained on my way. Moreover I am a big fan of continously providing high valuable software
            to customers and improving as a individual software developer and team each day. Therefore I am always
            eager to follow the rapidly evolving progress in Agile, Cloud Computing, Continous Integration & Continous
            Delivery.</p>
        <h3>Spare Time</h3>
        <p>
            When I am not sitting in front of my computer, I either spend my time with my girlfriend, watch one of my
            dozen
            favorite sports in TV or being active outside myself. While I like hanging out with friends at one of the
            lakes
            nearby and playing Beach Volleyball during summer time, I go down the Austrian hills with my skies when the
            snow falls in Winter.
            Next to my interests in sport I am a member of the voluntary fire brigade in my home town.
